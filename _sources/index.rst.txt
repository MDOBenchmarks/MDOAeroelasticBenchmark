Aeroelastic Optimization Benchmark
==================================

This website describes the benchmark model and optimization problems to be used by working group 1 for the special session on High-Fidelity Aeroelastic Design Optimization Applications and Benchmarks at the 2025 AIAA SciTech Forum.
These were first proposed in our paper at the 2024 AIAA SciTech Forum :cite:t:`AGray2024a`.

This website contains the model and problem description sections of that paper, with some small changes.
It should be considered the up to date reference for those planning to take part in the special session.
